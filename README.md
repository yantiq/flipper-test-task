3. Set the light and a phone as shown on the scheme

    </a>
    </p>

5. Remove extra space in the photo editor (I used _Lightroom_)

    <img alt="removing spaces" src="images/3.jpg" width="50%" />
    </a>
    </p>

6. In the _Lightroom_ app, open **Light** -> **Whites** `+100`, **Blacks** `-13`
7. If you want to reduce the shade, choose a **pen tool**, choose the white colour and remove all shades
8. Final view:

    <img alt="final view" src="images/4.jpg" width="50%" />
    </a>
    </p>


## _Optional step. Work with Photoshop_

I know, you want to get a high-quality picture and you are a pro, So here are some tips on how to make this picture look perfect:
1. Open the _Photoshop_ app on your computer and add the picture of the apple. Set **Brightness** to `+52` and **Contrast** to `+11`

2. Choose the **Object selection** tool, select the area with the apple, then _Photoshop_ does the magic

1. Choose **Layer**->**New**->**Layer** via **Cut**. Fill the background layer with white, then use an **eraser** or a **diagonal lasso** to remove irregularities. Additionally, you can go over the apple layer with the highlight tool to smooth out the tone.
2. Final view:

    </a>
