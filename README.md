4. Take a picture of the apple
5. Remove extra space in the photo editor (I used _Lightroom_)
6. In the _Lightroom_ app, open **Light** -> **Whites** `+100`, **Blacks** `-13`
7. If you want to reduce the shade, choose a **pen tool**, choose the white colour and remove all shades

## _Optional step. Work with Photoshop_

I know, you want to get a high-quality picture and you are a pro, So here are some tips on how to make this picture look perfect:
1. Open the _Photoshop_ app on your computer and add the picture of an apple. Set Brightness to +52 and Contrast to +11
2. Choose the Object selection tool, select the area with the apple, then _Photoshop_ does the magic
3. Choose Layer->New->Layer via Cut. Fill the background layer with white, then use an eraser or a diagonal lasso to remove irregularities. Additionally, you can go over the apple layer with the highlight tool to smooth out the tone.
4. Final view:

> Everything will take you from 7 to 17 minutes. Try it.
